# TODOX

A console-based C# Todo application

With this console app, you can:
- Add todos
- View added todos
- Remove, and 
- Update todos

## Why This?

Well, I just got my hands on C# and felt the best way to learn and improve was to build something and what project could there be than the "Glorious Todo" application?
Concepts you'll find:
- Interface
- Recursion
- Storing data in json file
- Dictionary & List
- IO Stream
- Light-weight validations

I know more refactoring will come in as I dig deeper into C# and the .NET ecosystem.
